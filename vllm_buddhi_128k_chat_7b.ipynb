Then, the computer makes its best guess and gets told if it's right or wrong. It learns from this feedback and uses it to improve its guesses for the next set of data.

        "Introduction\n",
        "Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein characterizes women as passive, disposable, and persons fulfilling a utilitarian purpose. Female characters such as Elizabeth, Agatha, Justin, Margaret, and Safie serve as a portal for the male characters in the story. They are frequently mentioned in the novel when they are used as instruments of love and devotion to teach men a lesson or provoke sentiments in men. Each woman introduced by the writer in Frankenstein has a certain role (Deborah). Mary Shelley registers proto-feminist views by showing the lives of six female characters through the eyes of three male narrators. By analyzing the treatment of these women using the theoretical perspective of gender studies, we can understand Shelley’s anti-patriarchal views on various women’s issues, such as marriage, motherhood, and gender roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Discussion\n",
        "While growing up in a toxic setting and surrounded by males such as his dad and spouse, Shelly’s difficulties led to her desiring feminine independence and the desire to be treated equally with men. Even though conventional causes were the primary impediment at the moment, Shelley’s ambition to live in a community where women are seen as humans were strong, necessitating the use of science and artwork to criticize patriarchy (Mellor and Mary 244). Shelly had personal contact with harmful and domineering masculinities as a result of her upbringing. She translated her personal experience into her work, in which she portrays the protagonists as anguished and self-tormented.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is a science-fiction book that explores the idea of women’s roles being disregarded in society. The work adequately addresses the issue of toxic masculinity (Mellor and Mary 240). When the book was published, during the nineteenth century, women were seen as property to the degree that they might be swapped for property. It is a way of categorizing males as seen to be socially powerful. Men were homophobic and sexist, which is termed toxic masculinity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Men integrate science and then use it to victimize women as they pursue greater heights in their pursuit of glory. The book is a science fiction in which men’s roles in society are characterized by valor (Mellor and Mary 240). The novel presents the concept of questioning the norms of society regarding gender roles for the first time. Victor Frankenstein sees women as nothing more than supporting characters. The disparity and absence of women in the community are well highlighted in Shelley’s book, laying the foundation for discussion about the prospective duties of women in society (Deborah). More particularly, Shelley’s work raises the question of what role science should play in masculinity, whether it perpetuates it or frees women from the bonds of toxic masculinity (Mellor and Mary 241). Men could incite violence against women in the nineteenth century without any disciplinary steps against them. Sexual harassment and domestic abuse are examples of this kind of violence. At its worst, society was patriarchal due to the normalization of violence against women, which resulted in bullying and aggressiveness against women.\n",
        "\n",
        "Women’s contributions to society are always ignored, and they are seen as properties to further men’s cause and exalt men to the status of heroes. Even in the twenty-first century, males remain strongly defined by traditionally masculine characteristics such as commitment to work, pride in athletic prowess, and the capacity to care for their families (Mellor and Mary 240). These characteristics in the twenty-first century are primarily attributable to historical makers, such as novelists, who had always favored toxic masculinity, particularly during a period when science became a worldwide role in shaping cultural norms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The novel has introduced the scientific period, which descriptively exposes toxic masculinity as the critical issue in the story. Men in the narrative are described as self-centered, while women are called gentle (London 255). The novel presents Frankenstein’s creation as created from numerous male bodies. Shelley develops the book by weaving together stories told by males, which permits the idea that it is just men who can tell scientific narratives. Shelley portrays the figure Victor Frankenstein as a narcissist who relates his past of unhappiness and how he made a spiteful monster (Deborah). Frankenstein’s character has offered adequate time to make choices and time to narrate his story of betrayal. The monster he makes is likewise allowed to share its account of how Frankenstein abused him. Introducing the story of patriarchy, women in this work are given limited acknowledgment; particularly, they are scarce as opposed to male characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the book, Shelley employs the scientific discipline to concentrate on arrogant males who avoid physical or emotional attachment. The novel emphasizes this when the monster is present on Frankenstein and Elizabeth’s wedding bed (London 260). Frankenstein adopts an aggressive strategy on their wedding night with Elizabeth. In the book, all males are called masculine since they bear self-destructive effects on the people around them, particularly women. The work presents a setting where women are underestimated in society. Although Shelley’s story is intricately self-aware of patriarchy, she effectively shows how female characters endure masculine aggression (London 260). She connects similar female conflicts to the monster’s struggle against masculine prejudice and rejection, most notably from its creator, Frankenstein. The story illustrates the challenges of women in the era of scientific knowledge and how such scientific advances are bringing more significant discrimination to women in society, precisely as Frankenstein conjured his monster to create horrific repercussions for his wife (Deborah). The book depicts how women are fighting males who are called heroic in society. The story seeks to combine the desire for creating a caring and happy household with men’s striving mentality, which frequently becomes despotic and hazardous to such a family.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shelley’s work explores the hideous nature of patriarchy. Frankenstein’s desire and ambition of being a hero brought him face to face-with his darkest reflection (London 254). Frankenstein regards the creature as an extension of himself. According to Shelley, humanity becomes hideous when they forsake human bonds and connections. Shelley’s work illustrates that males are constantly motivated by the urge to be mighty. To attain this goal, they must maintain a separation from the feminine to maintain domination. The book demonstrates how men get entangled in their sense of uniqueness to the point that they lose control of such illusions (London 255). However, such despicable illusions are focused exclusively on women, who bear the brunt of their repercussions. As in the story, Frankenstein’s monster quickly developed into his personality, and he started to lose his earlier character as a kind and caring family person.\n",
        "\n",
        "Justine is represented as an extremely passive character who is hardly heard throughout the book. She is mostly inconsequential in the book, playing several roles in Frankenstein’s primary narrative and her family until she is accused of murdering William Frankenstein (Rubenstein 169). Shelley attempts to depict her demeanor as serene and placid despite the difficulties of being wrongly convicted of murder. Justine asserts, “God alone knows how completely innocent I am. However, I do not claim that my protests will result in my acquittal; rather, I base my righteousness on a straightforward summary of the facts” (Rubenstein 192). Justine’s remark is the story’s central vocal aspect, indicating that Shelley invented the character primarily to serve as an inert and passive victim of predicament throughout the novel.\n",

        "Agatha, a youthful cottager, is another female character observed by the monster. She is seen as a lovely and compassionate female character whose primary goal is to demonstrate and embody all of the virtues and sensitivities of the human race (Rubenstein 169). The monster discovers these characteristics during his investigation since he has never encountered anybody with such sensitivity before. Agatha’s contact with her blind granddad shows her nature of empathy. “Agatha listened with reverence; her eyes occasionally full of tears” (Rubenstein 181). The monster describes that it is via the characteristics shown by Agatha, such as her inactivity and sensitive temperament, that the monster learns what it is to be in a good relationship and how to fall in love.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the monster crosses paths with Safie, another female figure who is acquainted with Agatha. She arrived from Arabia and had to learn how to speak English. While the monster took pleasure in observing an existent family via her activities, he learned how to mimic the English phrases Safie was taught. The creature received his first academic instruction via her (Rubenstein 170). Safie serves as a platform for the author in this instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Her participation is intended to further the monster’s experiences. Safie’s character is inextricably related to the monster’s deeds. The text indicates that her education is acknowledged only after the monster declares, “My days were dedicated in intense scrutiny…and I can brag that I progressed faster than the Arabian… I was able to mimic almost every phrase that was uttered. Additionally, I studied the science of words” (Hodges, 162). This comment dismisses Safie’s character as irrelevant, particularly her acquisition of English since if her learning were not beneficial to the monster, her participation in the narrative would be meaningless. The author uses her as a conduit to advance her thesis and convey information. Safie’s role in the narrative is irrelevant to her since she is how the creature learns to communicate in English.\n",
        "\n",
        "Elizabeth is presented as the engaged character of Frankenstein. From the start, she is a nice and subservient character. The monster regards her as property all through the story, as he writes, “I glanced at Elizabeth as mine – to guard, adore, and cherish.” I accepted all accolades upon her as though they were made to a treasure of mine” (London 261). Despite claiming to possess her, he kills her to make a message to his makers. When the creature learns of his maker’s love for Elizabeth, he becomes enraged and kills Elizabeth to inflict the greatest pain possible on his maker (London 262). They engaged in a battle with the monster as it pursued Elizabeth, while Frankenstein patrolled the grounds to protect his fiancée. Eventually, Elizabeth succumbs to the male-dominated chaos. Along with other female figures in the novel, she is degraded into an instrument of revenge. Simply put, she is seen as an object instead of a human being. She is represented as a weapon used to injure another individual, or rather as an instrument of vengeance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Margaret’s character is inextricably linked to the others since she likewise plays a passive duty in the story. She serves as a foil to Walton, who is his brother (London 264). She remains silent throughout the story since she is not presented to the reader. Margret is the greatest passive individual in the whole novel. Her presence is critical since Walton would have nothing to portray as a tale without her. Although the reader has no connection with her and has no way of knowing whether she exists, she remains the book’s most passive female character if she reads the letters addressed to her by her brother (London 264). The author cleverly used her to demonstrate the value of women in men’s life. Men appreciate their women despite being degraded, which is why they perceive them as theirs to guard and nurture. Additionally, Margret is a symbol of kindness and care because her mark remains visible given the invisibility and distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Female Monster is the most powerful female we encounter in Frankenstein. She informs her maker that she seeks the assistance of a monster of the other sex to join her on her missions and serve as a companion for herself (Hodges 160). She presents herself as a lonesome person, and she desires from her maker an equally horrible creature to accompany her. Frankenstein chooses not to finish the monster during the creation process after recognizing what it may lead to if the two dwell together for a long time. He considered the possibility that the thing was female and it will request to have offspring, which would be yet another calamity for Frankenstein and one that he might not be able to deal with on his own (Hodges 161). This is after considering what kind of race they may have if the animals evolve into a horde of monstrous creatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Frankenstein’s attitude toward females is shown by his creation of a female creature and subsequent destruction of the monster after detecting that she would bear offspring and the fact that the last fight might involve him and several demonic beings. Since he believed that the only goal that any female could have was to bear children, he saw women as instruments for producing children and assisting in the growth of families (Hodges 162). Women, in his opinion, are only designed for the fundamental role of reproduction, and if they become mothers, they should have no other interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the novel Frankenstein portrays women as passive and obedient instruments that are supposed to satisfy the male characters. The author used the Female monster to demonstrate to the audience how women are perilous, attractive characters for who everyone should be on the lookout for danger (Hodges160). To deal with a bunch of demons, Frankenstein claims the female creature he murdered would cause a slew of difficulties if they started asking for offspring. He then goes on to annihilate the female monster. Mary Shelley shaped her work via the use of female characters, emphasizing their submission and showing their inadequacy in comparison to males (Hodges 162). Female empowerment was emphasized by the author, who discussed the difficulties women face daily. Furthermore, she used them to bring attention to the men’s perceptions of women. Females should be subservient to their male counterparts and comply with everything they are told.\n",

        "Deep in the south of Egypt, on the west bank of the Nile facing the historic capital Thebes, stand two 60-foot-tall statues of the pharaoh Amenhotep III (14th century BCE). By the time the Romans annexed Egypt in 30 BCE, these colossi were an ancient remnant of the grandeur of the pharaoh’s mortuary temple, doomed by the Nile’s floodwaters, that they had once fronted. It was not just the visual impact of the lonely, poignant pair that captivated visitors, but also the extraordinary whistling sounds that emanated from the northern statue at dawn, likely the result of earthquake damage in 26 BCE.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Greek and Roman tourists tended to reinterpret the colossi through the lens of their own culture. They overlooked its pharaonic roots and instead saw Memnon, the mythical king of Aethiopia, serenaded by his anguished mother Eos, the goddess of dawn. It became a spectacle to behold and commemorate. Some 107 inscriptions have been catalogued at the bases of the statues: 61 in Greek, 45 in Latin, and one bilingual. They were not merely scratched onto the rock but engraved by professional stonecutters; the majority state some variation of ‘I have heard Memnon.’\n",
        "\n",
        "Visitors were a diverse set, hailing from throughout the Roman Empire: Anatolian, Levantine and Corinthian Greeks, provincial administrators coming upstream from Alexandria, a Gallic soldier, and people from faraway Rome itself. Journeying to the southern extremity of the Empire for many of these visitors was no small feat.\n",
        "\n",
        "An ancient traveller to Egypt or elsewhere had to consider the sheer investment of time, resources and effort. Yet throughout history, distant horizons and thirst for knowledge of the faraway has had relentless allure. Indeed, the notion that the Roman Empire consisted of isolated, immobile communities has been upended by modern scholarship. Recent examination of the empire’s vast territory, diverse peoples and long history reveals that travel offered adventure, novelty and opportunity for those with the resources or fortitude, making for a cosmopolitan ancient world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rome evolved from a small Latin settlement on the banks of the River Tiber in central Italy into a superpower, which at its most expansive in the 2nd century CE enveloped the entirety of the Mediterranean and stretched from northern England to the Middle East and, very briefly, the Persian Gulf.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without modern mechanised transportation and confronted by enormous distances and varying weather by season, the ancient perception of distance had to have differed from our own. A long-distance journey in the Roman Empire, it has been posited, was anywhere beyond five days’ reach: quite the departure from our current ideal of anywhere not accessible within a few hours by car, plane or train.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those journeys were enabled by the unprecedented political reality of the empire, which emerged after the fall of the already-expanding Republic in 27 BCE under the first emperor, Augustus. Augustus’ imperial autocracy brought an end to the repeated civil wars and disastrous political instability of the late Republic. The two-century-long Pax Romana (Roman peace), and the stabilising influence of one-state rule, imparted a newfound sense of security.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the ease of governance, economic growth and military activity, the empire was blanketed by a remarkably extensive network of infrastructure that united the far-flung corners of the realm with Rome and each other: paved roads, ports and harbours along coastlines, and navigable rivers supported a sophisticated maritime network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Civilians could wander this bounty, a privilege that did not go unnoticed among commentators of the age. Writing to his grief-stricken mother in the 1st century CE during his exile, the philosopher Seneca the Younger mentioned a ‘certain restlessness that makes man seek to change his abode and find a new home’. The sentiment was later echoed by the 2nd-century sophist Favorinus of Arelate (Arles), who observed that ‘divinity has given an indefatigable nature’ to man, ‘who travels “on land and on waves”’. The impulse to travel was not purely driven by the utilitarian, but was intrinsic to the human condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Romans were largely resigned to the population flux that was a corollary of their own expansion, but there was some attempt at control. Augustus prohibited the entry of senators and knights of high rank into Egypt without his direct permission, lest they set their avaricious gaze on the riches to be found in empire’s breadbasket. Much later, in 370 CE, as preserved in the Codex Theodosianus, students who came to Rome required documents from their provincial judges granting them ‘the right to come to the City’; in the case of misconduct, a student would ‘be publicly flogged, immediately put on board a boat, expelled from the City and returned home’. Students could remain in the urbs until the age of 20, after which any overstayers would be deported.\n",
        "\n",
        "Known restrictions like these were relatively few and far between, and specific rather than universalised. It was easier for the Romans to bring order and logic to their mobile society by simply keeping track. By the late Republic (c133-27 BCE), we see the emergence of legal terminology to categorise mobile individuals: peregrinus (non-citizen/foreigner), origo (one’s land of origin) and domicilium (one’s adopted homeland), to mention a few. By the 2nd century CE, the jurist Ulpius Marcellus legislated that ‘there is no barrier to anyone having his domicile wherever he wishes, provided somewhere is not forbidden to him’. Marcellus’ was a tacit acknowledgement that the empire rendered mobility an unavoidable, natural right. Control was the exception rather than the norm. Freedom of movement in the Roman Empire was as unhindered as it was guaranteed by law, if only because the state could not really control it.\n",
        "\n",
        "ut what propelled ancient Romans to venture forth beyond the confines of their native lands? While the average Roman lacked the time or resources for leisurely travel, for a more privileged elite minority, the impulse of wanderlust could be satisfied. Notably, the author and politician Pliny the Younger observed of his fellow Romans that:\n",
        "\n",
        "We are always ready to make a journey and cross the sea in search of things we fail to notice in front of our eyes … Whatever the reason, there are a great many things in Rome and near by which we have never seen nor even heard of, though if they were to be found in Greece, Egypt or Asia, or any other country which advertises its wealth of marvels, we should have heard and read about them and seen them for ourselves.\n",
        "Pliny’s perspective is a remarkably modern one. We take our homelands for granted, charmed instead by the exotic marvels of distant countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploration was already ingrained into Greco-Roman folklore. The Romans were well-acquainted with Homer’s Odysseus, who wandered the Mediterranean for a decade after the Trojan War before finally making it back to his native Ithaca. In his footsteps followed Aeneas, the protagonist of the Roman foundational epic the Aeneid, who meandered from Troy all the way to the destined site of Rome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually, an entire genre of geographic works and travel narratives catered to this curiosity. Geographies by Pausanias, Strabo and Pomponius Mela, and works such as Pliny the Elder’s encyclopaedic Natural History, all served to reveal foreign lands and peoples to the literate. Fiction was likewise a key medium: Encolpius, the protagonist of Petronius’ Satyricon, travels between Massalia (Marseille), Puteoli (in the Gulf of Naples) and Crotona (Calabria); Philostratus’ fantastical account of the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana chronicles his alleged extensive travels throughout the Roman Empire and beyond into Nubia, Babylon and India.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whereas disasters were once the force behind migration, personal agency came to assume greater influence\n",
        "\n",
        "And so, equipped with knowledge and hearsay of distant wonders, the venturesome and able satisfied their curiositas by seeking them. Egypt, ingrained in literary tradition as a land of marvels, was an epicentre of this early tourism. The general Germanicus visited the country in 19 CE in order ‘to study its antiquities’. According to the historian Tacitus, he sailed up the Nile and became mesmerised with ‘the vast ruins of ancient Thebes’, the hieroglyphs and the country’s glorious pharaonic past, and above all the ‘wonders’ of the vocal Colossi of Memnon (those giant twin statues actually celebrating Pharaoh Amenhotep III), the pyramids, and southern Elephantine and Syene. A century later, Emperor Hadrian followed a similar itinerary on his own grand tour.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other sightseers immortalised their presence via graffiti on monuments throughout the Nile Valley, from the Pyramids of Giza to the Colossi of Memnon and the tombs of the Valley of the Kings. We can partially trace the course of a certain touring Heliodorus of Caesarea Paneas, in the Golan Heights, who left an inscription on the base of the colossus stating that he had heard Memnon four times, after which he inscribed yet again on the temple of Isis at Philae to the south. We know it is the same Heliodorus because in both instances he makes reference to his two brothers, Zenon and Aianus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet the gigantic, even surreal legacy of Egypt’s monumental heritage, remnants of an enigmatic golden age already millennia old, elicited criticism and condescension from the Romans as well. While the fame of the pyramids may have ‘filled the whole earth’, Pliny the Elder could not help but see them as ‘frivolous pieces of ostentation’ and expressions of ‘great vanity’.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some Egyptians, nonetheless, were keen on receiving these awed visitors. Strabo claims that when he visited the city of Arsinoë, formerly – and aptly – named Crocodilopolis, he was taken by his guide to a lake where the sacred crocodile was kept. Tending priests would open the beast’s mouth and feed it ‘a small cake, dressed meat, and a small vessel containing a mixture of honey and milk.’ With the arrival, right after, of another visitor bearing offerings, the priests proceeded to chase the crocodile to repeat the process. Perhaps Strabo describes the first inklings of a tourist industry in which staged spectacles were part of the package.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was the imperial mercantile economic order, however, that was not just shaped by but also propelled the growth of human mobility. Significant numbers of traders, businessmen, transporters and enslaved people were regularly on the move. Shipwrecks stranded on the Mediterranean seabed, laden with lost cargo, attest to the dynamism and extent of this economic exchange. Stamps on otherwise unremarkable domestic items illuminate just how far a company might operate: the terracotta lamps produced by the firm Fortis have been detected in their hundreds beyond their principal northern Italian workshop in Mutina (Modena) as far as Germany, Gaul, Pannonia, Dacia, Dalmatia and, to a lesser extent, central Italy, Spain and north Africa: undoubtedly the achievement of a decentralised business model with agents and branches appointed in distant markets. Meanwhile in Ostia, the main port of the consumer giant that was Rome itself, the mosaics that spread out over the surface of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni, exhibiting the stationes (commercial offices) of its merchants, betray the once-cosmopolitan atmosphere of this bustling meeting point, with references to traders from modern Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sardinia and southern France.\n",
        "\n",
        "And with virtually no impediment to freedom of movement or domicile, the nature of migration underwent a fundamental transformation. Whereas once natural and manmade disasters were the historic force behind migration, personal agency came to assume increasingly greater influence. Whether temporary or permanent, there was a progressively voluntary aspect to migration.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was free will, and a perception of opportunity and choice, that drove traders and shipbuilders to Ostia. It was aspiration that influenced students, in a most temporary form of migration, to depart for their education. The 2nd-century writer Apuleius, who left his native Madaurus in Numidia (modern Algeria) to study in Carthage and Athens, then travel through Egypt, Asia Minor and Rome, embodied the well-educated and well-travelled Roman. Cities attained expertise for particular academic fields: Alexandria remained an intellectual powerhouse in philosophy and the sciences. Athens too retained its historic expertise in philosophy and rhetoric. Beirut was famed for its law school.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cities were naturally the main destination for migrants. Without a continuous stream of migrants, the larger cities of the premodern age, with mortality rates far exceeding birth rates, could not have grown or sustained their populations to the degree they did. By the dawn of the 1st century, Rome itself had reached 1 million inhabitants, an unprecedented demographic phenomenon at the time – and a significant proportion of this cohort comprised of enslaved people. The written record is laden with references to foreigners who continued to arrive, voluntarily or not. Epitaphs offer intimate insights into their identities, such as Basileus, the teacher from Nicaea in Bithynia (modern Turkey), or the Egyptian Fuscinus, who came to Rome with his wife Taon and became ‘the emperor’s provocator [gladiator]’ – they commemorated their deceased young son, who was given a Latin name, Serenus.\n",
        "\n",
        "The capital was such a draw that the Greek poet Athenaeus of Naucratis referred to it as ‘the epitome of the inhabited world, since you can see every single city settled in it’. Seneca, himself a Spaniard, observed how crowds ‘from all parts of the world’ came to Rome for myriad reasons ranging from employment to vice, but would then leave and ‘travel from one city to another; everyone will have a large proportion of foreign population’. The poet Juvenal, in his Satires, records the alleged displeasure directed at Rome’s migrants by Umbricius, who is in turn emigrating southwards from Rome to Cumae – ‘Syrian Orontes has long since poured itself into the Tiber, bringing with it its lingo and its manners’ – but he cannot bear ‘a Rome of Greeks’. Satirical it may be, but it encapsulates what must have been a real school of thought among an element of the city’s denizens: xenophobia was not beyond the Romans.\n",
        "\n",
        "It takes movement to bring exposure, and it takes exposure to instigate transformative change. With migrants, merchants, enslaved people, soldiers, tourists and pilgrims traversing the Mediterranean – visiting, settling, working and trading – like never before, the expansion of Rome set into motion an age of unparalleled intercultural communication and convergence. Never had the peoples of the Mediterranean world been so mobile, and thus so familiar with one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet the majority of the empire’s inhabitants were simple subsistence farmers, not long-distance voyagers; they were hardly inclined to travel or migrate unless necessity demanded it. But a ‘mobile society’ goes beyond sheer numbers. The ancient world, argues the historian Greg Woolf, was mobile in the sense that a minority of ‘movers’ (mostly, but not only, young, skilled males) travelled back and forth along well-traversed migration streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of them, the remaining majority of ‘stayers’, who rarely ventured beyond their small worlds, did not exist in isolation. The world belonged to the ever-more empowered movers, who showered the stayers with knowledge of the beyond: customs and aesthetics, ideas and information, materials and languages. Latin became the lingua franca of the Western empire, and increasingly a first language well beyond its native Latium, gradually evolving into today’s Romance languages. Meanwhile, in like manner, Greek persisted and flourished throughout the east. Multilingualism became a palpable facet of the empire’s multiculturalism. Roman religion, itself heavily influenced by the Greek, proliferated, and Eastern deities from the Egyptian and Greek pantheons and religions such as Mithraism, Judaism and – most momentously – Christianity were exported north and westward as far as Britain. It was the movers who seeded civilisation’s metamorphosis, permanently reshaping much of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n",
        "\n",
        "People throughout the empire would consider themselves Romans without ever having been to Rome itself\n",
        "\n",
        "The cities of the Roman Empire, as the principal nodes of communication and travel, came to serve as the junctions through which Roman standards of culture and lifestyle could infiltrate the provinces. Roman-ness became synonymous with civic life, and references abound to barbarian natives becoming civilised Romans upon their adoption of urban ways. The mundane repetitions of daily life allowed a ‘Roman’, whether in Rome or Britain, to form and consolidate their identity, and so to participate in a ‘shared cultural discourse’ that made the empire a cohesive whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faced with an increasingly ambiguous and heterogeneous concept of Roman-ness, commentators looked to, and fabricated, the past to make sense of their present. In their view, their ancestral city-state, born seven centuries before the onset of the emperors, was never a homogeneous community with a distinct autochthony, but an amalgam of ethnicities: Italian Latins, Etruscans and Sabines, and eastern Arcadians, Achaeans, Pelasgians and Trojans. A spirit of inclusivity defined the city from the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "It certainly made the new world of motley Romans more palatable. People throughout the empire would consider themselves Romans without ever having been to Rome itself. ‘Romans’ included millions of diverse people spread throughout the Mediterranean and beyond who, by the fruits of mobility, were living quintessentially Roman lives. Strong regional variations persisted, but were attenuated by an increasing commonality; mobile individuals and entire communities were assuming increasingly complex hybrid identities. The historian Claudia Moatti has called this coalescence ‘cosmopolitisation’: a process rather than a philosophy, in which people, marked by their own experiences with mobility, accumulated affiliations. Fundamentally, it resembles modern diasporas that spread traditions, languages and identities far and wide – from British Indians to Italian Americans, the dance goes on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identities could co-exist and complement each other, but Roman-ness itself provided the focal point of an admirable multiculturalism to millions of otherwise disparate peoples, a universal identity that anyone could aspire to attain. Aristides encapsulated this evolution succinctly, praising the city for having ‘caused the word “Roman” to be the label, not of membership in a city, but of a common nationality’.\n",
        "\n",
        "This ‘common nationality’ was not merely a legal concept: most inhabitants of the empire were not actual Roman citizens until the Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 CE granted full citizenship to all free men. Until then, this plethora of Romans in all but city and citizenship, with all their distinctions, were bound together by what must have been a more practical and even emotional sense of kinship. Indeed, ‘Roma communis nostra patria est’, declared the Greek-speaking jurist Modestinus in the 3rd century CE: ‘Rome is our common fatherland.’\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s hardly a leap to declare that, some two millennia ago, in the Roman Empire, an early version of ‘globalisation’ first reared its head. It was this interconnectivity and the Roman tolerance of plurality that glued the empire together and made it ultimately work and flourish for centuries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make no mistake: liberal ideals were not the impetus behind the ‘cosmopolitisation’ of the Roman Empire. There was no progressive democracy, but an imperialist machine that expanded and thrived through violent conquest, subjugation, exploitation and slavery. Nor was ‘Romanisation’ an absolute or uniform process throughout the empire: it was felt less acutely in relatively remote, little-urbanised regions. Xenophobia and nativism contradicted the supposed inclusivity of imperial Roman-ness, which was in itself bound up with notions of the perceived superiority of Roman civilisation. Rome could both embrace and disdain the foreign. Just as Egypt’s wonders were marvellous and frivolous, so was the diversity of Rome’s migrants a source of pride and dread. Xenophilic or xenophobic, there is no use in generalising the attitudes of the time: the inconsistency is a reflection of how Romans across the empire were processing their increasingly cosmopolitan reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cultural transformations brought by Rome permanently altered the course of European history and society. The extent of this legacy demands we question the idea that Romanisation was solely the homogenisation of powerless, victimised native peoples into a pre-existing social order. Instead, in multifarious ways, these peoples participated in the creation of a new world. For better or worse, that world was ripe for exploration, familiarisation, interaction and, ultimately, self-introspection: travel was opening and deeply transforming minds.\n",

        "The U.S. Civil War was the most destructive and most significant war in Western history between 1815 and 1914 during the world war. A bitter dispute over the union government’s ability to abolish slavery in the unincorporated territories led to the Civil War (Ponsa-Kraus). After the election of Abraham Lincoln as the first Republican president of the United States in 1860, several states from the South withdrew from the Union and fashioned the Confederate States of America. Secession was not recognized as legally valid by the new Lincoln administration and the vast majority of Northerners. By splitting the now-defunct United States into several small, feuding republics, they believed it would taint democracy and create a dangerous precedent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fort Sumter in Charleston Bay was the site of a triggering incident in April 1861. Confederate forces launched an assault on the federal garrison that day, claiming control and compelling federal forces to capitulate by lowering the American flag. As a result of the rebellion, Lincoln called in the militia. The Confederacy obtained another four slave regions after its seceding. By 1861, thousands of men fought on a 1210-mile front from Missouri to Virginia. A novel state of West Virginia was formed as a result of Union victories around Manassas Junction in Virginia\n",

        "The big engagements, however, did not commence until 1862. Engagements such as Shiloh in Tennessee, Antietam in Maryland, and Fredericksburg in Virginia set the stage for bigger campaigns and battles to come. President Abraham Lincoln’s original aim of limited war to reinstate the Union was abolished in the face of the novel approach of a “total war” aimed at destroying the South and its essential institution of slavery. The Confederate army was defeated in several battles, which led to its surrender to the federal government. The main Confederate troops gave in by the spring of 1865 (Matsui). On May 10, 1865, Union troops captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Georgia, ending the Civil War.\n",

        "For nearly three decades, the Berlin Wall was a tangible representation of the so-called Iron Curtain and the political divisions in Europe. When Mikhail Gorbachev took control of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1985, he did so with the intention of revamping the country’s economy and government. He dismantled the secret police and introduced perestroika (economic restructuring) in an attempt to begin mending relationships with Western European countries and the United States. By studying the consequences of the collapse of the USSR, students today can gain an understanding of how the end of the Cold War affected U.S. and Soviet relationships, and how it led to the current political and economic climate between the two countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to understand the consequences related to the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is critical to first examine the overarching causes for the USSR’s downfall. Gorbachev’s loosening of governmental power created a domino effect in which Eastern European alliances began to crumble, inspiring countries such as Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to declare their independence. The Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989, leading East and West Germany to officially reunite within a year, ending the Cold War. Once the Berlin Wall fell, citizens in Eastern European countries such as Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania staged protests against their pro-Soviet governments, hastening the collapse of communist regimes across the former Soviet bloc. Other countries—such as the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine—followed suit, creating the Commonwealth of Independent States. By the end of 1989, eight of the nine remaining republics had declared independence from Moscow, and the powerful Soviet Union was finally undone. By the summer of 1990, all the formerly communist Eastern European officials had been replaced by democratically elected governments, setting the stage for the region’s reintegration into Western economic and political spheres.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dismantling of the Soviet Union had many long-lasting effects on the global economy and the region’s foreign trade. Its downfall increased the United States’ influence as a global power and created an opportunity for corruption and crime in Russia. It also prompted many cultural changes and social upheavals in former Soviet nations and smaller neighboring communist countries. Between 1989 and 1991, the gross national product in Soviet countries fell by 20 percent, ushering in a period of complete economic breakdown.\n",

              "\"The essay discusses the fall of the Berlin Wall and its significance in the context of the collapse of the Soviet Union, highlighting its impact on US-Soviet relations, political landscape, economy, and foreign trade.\\n\\nMikhail Gorbachev's ascension to power in 1985 marked a turning point in Soviet history. His policies, including perestroika and the dismantling of the secret police, weakened the USSR's government and relationships with Western European countries and the US. This resulted in a series of events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Eastern European communist regimes set off a chain reaction, with countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia declaring independence, leading to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the replacement of communist governments with democratic ones in Eastern Europe.\\n\\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union had far-reaching consequences. Economically, it resulted in a decline in the gross national product of Soviet countries by 20% between 1989 and 1991, leading to a complete economic breakdown. Politically, the US emerged as a global superpower, while Russia saw an increase in corruption and crime. Culturally, there were significant shifts in values and traditions.\\n\\nThe essay argues that studying the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union is crucial for understanding the current political and economic relationship between Russia and the US. The essay provides an insightful analysis of the historical significance of the event and its impact on global politics and economics. Overall, it demonstrates how the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War era and paved the way for a new era in international relations.\""
